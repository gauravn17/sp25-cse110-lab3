## 📈 What I worked on “Yesterday”
<!-- 1–2 bullet points per person -->
- **Gaurav**  
  - Finished wiring up the custom issue template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml`)  
  - Validated CSS and fixed the stray ampersand in `.card &.highlight`  
- **Bob**  
  - Added margin‑longhand examples in `styles.css` on branch `issue‑6‑margin‑longhand`  
  - Poked at GitHub Pages deployment glitches  
- **Parwiz**  
  - Drafted the `standup.md` and reviewed the Agile lab write‑up  
  - Created initial label set (e.g. `style`, `enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`)

## 🎯 What I plan to work on “Today”
- **Gaurav**  
  - Merge my `task.yml` rebase, then open PR linking to Issue #X  
  - Tackle nested selectors (`:has()`) and test browser support  
- **Bob**  
  - Finalize the long/short margin, padding, border examples in CSS  
  - Draft issue for inline vs. external CSS examples  
- **Parwiz**  
  - Create Issues for each remaining checklist item (flexbox, grid, media queries)  
  - Write up the SWOT analysis and save it to `admin/adr/swot.pdf`

---

## 🛑 Blockers
- **Gaurav**  
  - Still resolving a rebase conflict in `task.yml`  
- **Bob**  
  - Uncertainty on how to structure the custom issue template options (single vs. multiple checkboxes)  
- **Parwiz**  
  - Need clarification on whether nested selectors are acceptable despite validator warnings  

---

## 📌 Notes & Decisions
- We agreed to keep all CSS in a single `styles.css` file for this lab, and demo one inline style in `index.html`.  
- Jira‑style story points: assigning 1 point per checklist item – helps us see progress.
